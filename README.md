# BAP1 Texture Analysis Project

This repository contains code to implement a texture analysis model of CT scans of patients with pleural mesothelioma for the differentiation of BAP1 mutation status.

The methodology includes a radiomic feature extraction to extract a large magnitude of quantitative features from CT images followed by a prediction pipeline that performs feature selection and classification of mutation status. Additionally, we implement methods for analyzing radiomic feature robustness and stability over image perturbations to assess the reliability and reproducibility of results.
